# Automation_Sample_Project

This is a sample Unit test automation project. It consists of testing and verifying the login method of a specific website with Selenium Webdriver.
This project is executed in the Python programming language and with the help of Python packages such as (Selenium webdriver, HtmlTestRunner etc.)
Here, people can use my code and format example for their projects.

I have also added The HTML test reports which include both valid and invalid tests.
